## Distributions of Model Accuracy
After 1000 iterations for k = 10:
Mean average = 95.58823529411639;
Standard deviation = 1.5996332109454424E-24;

## Analysis of different error types
Out of all of the predicted, the correct positive predictions are true positive, and the correct negative predictions are true negative. The wrong negative predictions that are actually positive are false negative. The wrong positive predictions that are actually negative are false negative.

Precision is how many predicted positive in the predictions.
Precision = true positive / (true positive + false negative).

Recall is how many predicted positive out of all actual positives.
Recall = true positive / (true positive + false negatives).
